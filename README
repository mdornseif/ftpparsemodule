ftpparse is a library for parsing FTP LIST responses.

This Python extension module is completely based on Dan Bernstein's ftpparse
library at http://cr.yp.to/ftpparse.html Mr. Bernstein requests you to
inform him if you use his library in an commercial application.

The Python wrapper was hacked by drt@un.bewaff.net - http://c0re.jp/

You might be able to find more Information and updates at

To install type (as root)

$ python setup.py install

then you can read the documentation typing

$ pydoc -w ftpparse
$ lynx ftpparse.html

This module was developed using Python 2.1.
